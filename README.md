- **What was your key takeaway?** 
  - Code reviewing can be a great way to share ideas with your peers and help deepen both of your understandings of certain concepts. When Person A is able to explain something to the Person B, and Person B fully understands those ideas after the explanation, then both of you have benefited from that process.
